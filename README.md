A clean, elegant, and conversion-focused **consulting / agency landing page** built with **HTML, Tailwind CSS (CDN)**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.  
This project is part of my **web design & frontend development portfolio**, showcasing my ability to design professional business pages with strong structure, clarity, and visual hierarchy.
